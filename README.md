Welcome to the Marvel React API

Github: https://github.com/dmorris95/Marvel-React-API

This application uses Axios to make API calls to the Marvel API. Before running the application ensure you get a timestamp, public apikey and a hash in order to connect to the Marvel API.

The public and private keys can be gathered from the Marvel website. The hash is an MD5 hash of your timestamp, private key, and public key

When running the application it will pull a list of different characters from Marvel's Comic books and display them for the user. By clicking on the character a detail page will appear and be updated with information based on the character clicked.
